# O(n * logn) quick sort time complexity. the time complexity is O(nÂ²), if the pivot is always the smallest or largest element in the array.
# The time complexity of quick sort is determined by the number of recursive calls that are made. 
# Each recursive call processes approximately n/2 elements, so the total number of recursive calls is approximately log(n). 
# The running time of each recursive call is O(n), so the total running time is O(n * logn)

# O(logn) is a logarithmic space complexity. In the worst case, the space complexity is O(n), if the pivot is always the smallest or largest element in the array.
# This is because the call stack grows with the number of recursive calls, and the number of recursive calls is logarithmic in the size of the input.
