# O(n) linear time, since the running time is directly proportional to the size of the input. 
# If the input size is n, the linear search will take n steps to complete.

# O(1) linear space complexity, This linear search algorithm has a space complexity of O(1), 
# since it only requires a constant amount of memory regardless of the size of the input. 
# It creates a single variable (i) to store the loop index, but the memory required for this variable is constant.
